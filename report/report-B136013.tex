\section{Introduction}
This experiment measures the running time and speedup of a C program for multiple configurations using openMP on Cirrus supercomputer. The source code contains two (2) for loops, initialization procedures and time reporting commands. We used a variety of schedule methods on the loops which are implemented in openMP API multithread programming library. Next, we pick the fastest scheduling options for each loop and run them using different number of threads, in order to observe which configuration had the best speedup results.

\section{Visual Representation}
	
\subsection{Execution Time}
In the following section, there are graphs for the execution time and speed up of the given loops using different scheduling configurations like static, dynamic, guided against chunksizes such as 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64.

The active number of threads has been set to four (4) for all of the following executions in order to choose the best schedule taking into account only the running time.

In Figure 1 and 2 are the execution time results in seconds of loop 1 and 2 for each one of the different scheduling configurations. As a result, in this series of executions the best scheduling options are shown in Table 1:

\begin{table}[h]
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{||l|c|l||}
			\hline
			{\bf Loop No} & {\bf Schedule}\\
			\hline
			Loop 1         &  schedule(guided, 4)\\
			Loop 2         &  schedule(dynamic, 16)\\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Best scheduler options on four (4) threads}

\end{table}

\subsection{Speedup}
Speedup occurs dividing T1/Tp where Tp is the execution time of the process running over p threads, and T1 is the same for one (1) thread.

As regards the speepup measurements, we picked up the best scheduling options for each loop as defined in the first two (2) lines of the source code shown in Listing 1: loops.c based on Table 1 results. Now, we are going to measure the speedup of the experiment running against different numbers of threads including 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 16.

\lstinputlisting[language=C, firstline=2, lastline=3, caption=loops.c]{../template/loops_parallel-B136013.c}

Figure 3 and 4 depict the results of speedup in the application. As expected, when we increase the number of threads running the experiment, speedup increases or stays constant over a point.
